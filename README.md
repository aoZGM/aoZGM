# aoZGM - Discord Bot

This Discord bot is designed for Albion Online players and guilds. It serves as a versatile registration bot, allowing players to link their Discord accounts with their in-game Albion Online accounts. The bot provides various features, including tracking ZVZ events, maintaining player statistics, implementing a robust blacklist system with real-time monitoring, and offering the ability to invite guests from alliances. Additionally, it reports ZVZ events with 20 or more players and maintains a Google Spreadsheet for easy access to player activity data. This bot enhances communication and management within the Albion Online gaming community on Discord

## Features

- Albion Online registration bot, registers a Discord account linked to the in-game account in Albion Online.
- When a ZVZ (Zerg vs. Zerg) event takes place, it records a score for players with 20 or more members of the guild to track their activity.
- Players can inquire about their statistics in Discord (with creatively designed ranks).
- Comprehensive blacklist system with monitoring: if a blacklisted player joins an alliance or guild, a notification is sent to a channel every 3 hours.
- When a ZVZ event involving 20 or more players occurs, it reports this in a Discord channel.
- Ability to invite guests from an alliance, which unfortunately still needs to be hardcoded into the bot.
- A Google Spreadsheet containing information on all players for easy activity overview.
